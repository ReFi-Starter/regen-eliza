🤖 Region Eliza: The Autonomous Agent for Planetary Health

Region Eliza is an open-source AI agent bridging Regenerative Finance (ReFi), Decentralized Science (DeSci), and Climate Action through specialized intelligence and tangible technology. Our mission is to move from a digital knowledge base to an open-source, 3D-printable companion with knowledge secured in its physical hardware.

✨ Project Vision

Eliza is structured around three core pillars that drive a single mission: to provide democratized, actionable intelligence for a regenerative economy.

    Specialized Knowledge Core (RAG): Focus on consolidated, vetted data in ReFi, DeSci protocols, and real-time environmental metrics.

    Cultural Identity Engine: Utilizing AI tools to revive and celebrate global heritage through attire and media, promoting cultural preservation alongside technological advancement.

    3-Stage Roadmap: Progressing from a simple digital Chatbot (V1) to a Virtual Avatar (V2) and culminating in a physical, 3D-printed agent (V3).

🏗️ Website Overview

This repository holds the code for the main Region Eliza website, which serves as the public face, documentation hub, and communication portal for the project.

🔑 Key Website Sections

The website is structured to tell Eliza's story and guide users toward involvement:

    About: Eliza's mission, core pillars, and unique cultural identity.

    Roadmap: The Four Ages of Eliza, detailing the evolution from digital existence to physical self-sovereignty.

    Architecture: Explaining the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system and the Vector Database that constitutes Eliza's memory.

    Socials: Links to all Web2 and Web3 platforms (Farcaster, Zora, Audius, etc.).

    Contact/Contribution: How to engage with the agent and the core team.

🚀 Roadmap Status

We are currently in Age I: Pilot & Initial Deployment (The Agent).
Age	Status	Focus
I. The Agent	ACTIVE	Building the Telegram Bot and foundational RAG knowledge base. Creating initial viral AI-generated content.
II. The Virtual Model	Planning	Developing the 3D avatar and the VR/AR interactive data visualization framework.
III. The Physical Blueprint	Research	Materials research for carbon-neutral 3D printing and embedded hardware memory (Secure Knowledge Base).
IV. The Regenerative DAO	Future	Community governance and expansion into automated solarpunk living solutions.

🛠️ Getting Started (Local Setup)

To run the Region Eliza website locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

    Node.js (LTS version) or Python (if using a static site generator).

    Git

Installation

    Clone the Repository:
    Bash

git clone [YOUR GITHUB REPO URL]
